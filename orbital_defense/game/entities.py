"""
Game entities for Orbital Defense.

This module defines the game objects that interact in the Orbital Defense game,
including the defense station, enemies, and other interactive elements.

The entities in this module extend the physics objects defined in the physics module,
adding game-specific properties and behaviors. Each entity type has specific properties
and behaviors that define how it interacts with the game world:

- Defense Station: Player-controlled entity that can aim and fire weapons
- Asteroid: Simple enemy that follows gravitational physics
- Enemy Ship: AI-controlled ship that can navigate toward the planet

All entities interact through physics simulations, particularly gravitational forces.
